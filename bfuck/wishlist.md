Thanks to [user arthaud](https://github.com/arthaud/c2bf) for providing a C to Brainfuck compiler which is an essential
and helpfull tool in this project. 

~~In order to fast progress with this project we might need an interpreter or compiler for a common~~
~~or once common language like **C** , **Scheme**, **BASIC**, **Forth** etc. I know that there was once a~~ 
~~C to brainfuck compiler but as it has not been on github it might already be gone now.~~

Also we need a [Thue to Brainfuck interpreter](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck_interpreter_in_Thue) like the one
described on the [esolang wiki](https://esolangs.org/).
